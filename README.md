CodeGlimpse
===========

CodeGlimpse is an online platform that allows users to easily share and manage code snippets. It offers the convenience of making snippets private by adding a passcode for added security. Users can quickly log in and sign up using their Google account with just one click, giving them access to their code snippets stored in their personal library.

Technologies Used
-----------------

* **Frontend:** CodeGlimpse is built using React for the user interface and Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
* **Backend:** The backend of CodeGlimpse is powered by Python, utilizing the FAST API framework. We've chosen PostgreSQL as our database management system, and we interact with it using the SQLAlchemy ORM for seamless database operations.

Features
--------

* **Code Sharing:** Users can easily paste and share code snippets with others, making collaboration and knowledge sharing a breeze.
* **Privacy:** CodeGlimpse allows users to set a passcode for their snippets, keeping them private and secure.
* **One-Click Google Login:** We provide a seamless login experience with one-click Google authentication, simplifying user access to their personal code library.
